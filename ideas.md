## Idea 1: "Clinical Serenity"
*   **Design Movement**: Soft Modernism / Medical Spa Aesthetic
*   **Core Principles**: Trust, Empathy, Clarity, Calm.
*   **Color Philosophy**: A palette of **Sage Green**, **Soft Slate Blue**, and **Warm White**. Green represents growth and renewal (weight loss), while blue anchors the medical authority (hormone therapy). The combination avoids the coldness of pure clinical white.
*   **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric split-screens for hero sections to balance human connection (images) with information (text). Generous padding to let content breathe.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Soft Card Styling**: Content cards with large border-radius (approx 1rem) and very subtle, diffused shadows (`box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`).
    *   **Wave Dividers**: Gentle SVG wave dividers between sections to create a flow, mimicking the organic nature of health.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**: "Gentle Guidance". Buttons should have a soft lift on hover. Transitions should be slow and smooth (ease-out, 300ms).
*   **Animation**: Fade-in-up for text elements as the user scrolls. Images should have a subtle zoom-out effect on load.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headers**: *Tenor Sans* or *Playfair Display* (Humanist Serif) – adds a touch of elegance and approachability, crucial for menopause/hormone topics.
    *   **Body**: *Lato* or *Nunito Sans* – highly readable, rounded sans-serifs that feel friendly but professional.

## Idea 2: "Evidence-Based Precision"
*   **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / Neo-Grotesque
*   **Core Principles**: Authority, Science, Results, Structure.
*   **Color Philosophy**: **Deep Navy**, **Cool Grey**, and **Electric Teal** accents. Navy commands respect and implies medical expertise. Teal provides a modern, energetic "active" color for CTAs.
*   **Layout Paradigm**: Modular Grid. Information is organized in strict, aligned blocks. Use of vertical lines to separate content columns.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Frosted Glass**: Glassmorphism overlays for text on top of medical imagery.
    *   **Data Motifs**: Abstract geometric lines or dots in the background representing data points and medical precision.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**: "Instant Response". Buttons change state sharply (color swap). Hover effects are crisp.
*   **Animation**: Staggered reveal for list items (e.g., "Benefits of HRT"). No organic curves; motion is linear and direct.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headers**: *Oswald* or *Manrope* – Bold, geometric sans-serifs that look like medical charts or headlines.
    *   **Body**: *Roboto* or *Source Sans Pro* – Neutral, objective, and extremely legible.

## Idea 3: "Vitality & Balance"
*   **Design Movement**: Organic Modernism
*   **Core Principles**: Holistic, Warm, Life-Changing, Personal.
*   **Color Philosophy**: **Terracotta**, **Sand**, and **Charcoal**. Moving away from "medical blue" entirely to focus on the *lifestyle result* of the treatment. Warm tones suggest skin, sun, and vitality.
*   **Layout Paradigm**: Overlapping layers. Images often break the grid or overlap with text boxes to create depth and a magazine-editorial feel.
*   **Signature Elements**:
    *   **Organic Masks**: Images masked in non-rectangular shapes (arches or blobs).
    *   **Texture**: Subtle grain or paper texture on backgrounds to remove digital harshness.
*   **Interaction Philosophy**: "Tactile". Buttons feel like physical buttons (slight press effect).
*   **Animation**: Parallax scrolling for background textures. Elements float slightly.
*   **Typography System**:
    *   **Headers**: *DM Serif Display* – High contrast, classic, editorial.
    *   **Body**: *Quicksand* or *Mulish* – Rounded, friendly, modern.
